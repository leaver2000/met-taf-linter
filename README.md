# METLAB

The met-lab application is intended to connect commonly used weather products.

A map, skewt, and meteogram are some of the most common use tools for analyzing forecast model data.

METLABS objective is to take the UI a step further and turn visual representation
of forecast model data into the control platform for other weather products
